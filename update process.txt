How to update Story Primer from this repo
1. Fix the book
2. Update the version in the .bloomCollection file
3. After review, get the new version tagged and pushed to origin
4. If not already done, set StoryPrimer.pdf and the thumbnail png files to read-only so they won't be overwritten on upload.
5. Make sure the BloomSandbox environment variable is set false
6. Use a recent installed BetaInternal (version as desired as long as it's installed, not dev)
7. Open the Story Primer .bloomCollection file in Bloom as a collection
8. Log in to BloomLibrary with gordon_martin@sil.org account
9. Upload to website.
